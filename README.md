# Port Scanner
Silly little port scanner. I would not recommend using this for the following reasons:

1. It does not verify an IP exists
2. It does not provide DNS resolution to check if an IP exists for a given domain name.
3. It does not do half-open scanning.

Syntax: python3 ./portscanner.py <IP ADDRESS OR DOMAIN NAME>
